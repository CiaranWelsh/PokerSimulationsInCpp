What am I trying to do?
=======================

- Write a fully functional poker api
- I want it to be possible to play genuine games of poker with arbitrary numbers of players.
- simulate poker games with random actions
- Be able to read and write game hands from various sources and replay them
- calculate poker statistics on full games.

	*/
	Poker poker;
	poker.setNumPlayers(2);
	poker.setSmallBlind(1);
	poker.setBigBlind(2);
